## <a name="intro">Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to view my CV! If you can't see it, click [here](https://github.com/KeirSimmons/CV/blob/master/CV.pdf)! Or click [here](https://github.com/KeirSimmons/CV/raw/master/CV.pdf) to download it :) .

I absolutely hate boring, plain-text documents whipped up in Microsoft Word with a variety of ugly-positioned textboxes - don't we all? In the spirit of not reinventing the wheel, I forked [this beautiful LaTeX template](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and slightly modified it for my own personal use.

[**Changes**] I have added several additional styles to tailor the template to my profile. This includes adding a section for MOOCs (or "Professional Development"), 'progress'-style bars for my technical skills etc etc. I haven't documented these simply as that is not the purpose of this repo. That said, feel perfectly free to use anything additional I've added without credit.

[**Personal data**] At the end of the day this is a CV, and it has a lot of my personal details attached to it (phone number, address, etc). For this reason if you're going to fork this repo please edit these out! I have left them in place in the file so potential employers can contact me (which, by the way, feel free to - I am actively searching for new opportunities!).
