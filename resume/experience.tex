       % \item {Lead the \emph{Adversary} team which focused on validating the effectiveness of Ascent's autonomous vehicles over all possible scenarios through the use of simulation and advanced adversarial search techniques.}
        \item {Exposed and proposed solutions to incapabilities in the vehicle AI during simulation before proceeding to in-car testing via an array of advanced Bayesian Optimisation-based adversarial search methods in our main project, \emph{DOJO}, as the leader of the \emph{Adversary} team.}
        \item {Led multiple end-to-end machine learning-based projects specifically with the goal of training our vehicles to adopt a human-like behaviour. The results of these projects have been used in publications at leading conferences worldwide.}
       % \item {Created a full end-to-end stack which clusters driving behaviours of vehicles on Japanese roads from raw 4K HD top-down drone video data. This data has been converted to an API and used in various other projects within the Adversary and vehicle AI team.}

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Solved the \emph{peak-demand} problem where the electrical grid cannot generate enough energy during peak times, completion of which formed my Master's thesis at \emph{UCL} for the MSc in \emph{Computational Statistics \& Machine Learning} and earned the highest possible classification.}
        \item {Tackled the problem through the use of peak-shifting; using reinforcement learning (PPO) to find an optimal control policy of purchasing and storing energy in a battery to shift consumer's demand for energy outside of peak times.}
        \item {Achieved perfect peak-shifting and a reduction in energy consumption and cost of utility bills by over 20\%.}
