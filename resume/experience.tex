      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Heading the \emph{Adversary} team which focuses on validating the effectiveness of our autonomous vehicles over all possible scenarios through the use of simulation and advanced adversarial search techniques.}
        \item {Exposed and proposed solutions to incapababilities in the vehicle AI during simulation before proceeding to in-car testing via an array of advanced Bayesian Optimisation-based adversarial search methods in our main project, \emph{DOJO}.}
        \item {Led multiple end-to-end machine learning-based projects specifically with the goal of training our vehicles to adopt a human-like behaviour. The results of these projects have been used in publications at leading conferences worldwide.}
        \item {Created a full end-to-end stack which clusters driving behaviours of vehicles on Japanese roads from raw 4K HD top-down drone video data. This data has been converted to an API and used in various other projects within the Adversary and vehicle AI team.}
        %\item {Engineered the company's reinforcement learning architecture, allowing for the training and comparison of various state-of-the-art algorithms, which was subsequently employed in a large-scale project involving development of a self-driving car simulator for our main client.}
        %\item {Employed and modified the a3c actor-critic algorithm to train a drone to fly in a simulated office environment using Gazebo and ROS. The trained model was transferred to a real micro FPV drone in the office to validate our simulation of the real world.}

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Solved the \emph{peak-demand} problem where the electrical grid cannot generate enough energy during peak times, completion of which formed my Master's thesis at \emph{UCL} for the MSc in \emph{Computational Statistics \& Machine Learning} and earned the highest possible classification.}
        \item {Tackled the problem through the use of peak-shifting; using reinforcement learning (PPO) to find an optimal control policy of purchasing and storing energy in a battery to shift consumer's demand for energy outside of peak times.}
        \item {Achieved perfect peak-shifting and a reduction in energy consumption and cost of utility bills by over 20\%.}
        \item {The code and full thesis is available on \href{https://github.com/KeirSimmons/RL-Optimal-Peak-Shift}{\emph{GitHub}}.}
