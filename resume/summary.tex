As an Applied Scientist at Amazon, I lead a team improving the efficiency of the logistics network via NLP for address recognition. Having developed an improved address validation and hierarchical mapping system at scale, Amazon can now deliver more packages in less time, resulting in an annual uplift of 400,000,000 USD in Japan alone.

Prior to Amazon, I led numerous projects at \emph{Ascent Robotics} with the goal of developing fully autonomous vehicles for Japanese roads, requiring methods in adversarial search, computer vision, and deep reinforcement learning. I also completed a research internship at the internationally-renowned \emph{AI Research Center} \& AI energy company \emph{Informetis} in Tokyo, been awarded the prestigious \emph{Daiwa Scholarship}, and hold Master's degrees with the highest possible merit from three top 10 universities around the world.

My passion is to improve everyday-life via automation by pushing and challenging the frontiers of machine learning research and application. With over 15 years of daily development experience in a vast array of languages, an exemplary background both academically and in industry, I hope to further aspire towards these goals throughout the rest of my personal career.

%As a research engineer at \emph{Ascent Robotics}, I am focusing on the company's mission of developing level 4 self-driving cars by 2020, through the combined use of neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Prior to this, I completed an internship at Ascent, and also the \emph{Artificial Intelligence Research Center} in Tokyo through the \emph{Daiwa Scholarship} programme, and subsequently completed an MSc in Computational Statistics \& Machine Learning at UCL. My thesis at UCL was conducted at \emph{Informetis}, Japan, and focused on the peak demand problem in energy systems, where my reinforcement learning-based solution resulted in perfect \emph{peak shifting}, and a reduction in energy consumption and  utility bill prices by over 20\%; far out-performing existing results in the field.%

%Currently enrolled on the MSc \emph{Computational Statistics and Machine Learning} programme at \emph{UCL} and will be graduating in September, 2018. As a 2015-17 \emph{Daiwa Scholar}, I completed a research placement within reinforcement learning (RL) at the \emph{AI Research Center} in Tokyo alongside learning the Japanese language. I subsequently worked as the lead RL research engineer at \emph{Ascent Robotics}, a self-driving car startup in Tokyo, where I helped develop the core RL research platform and used this in high profile client projects such as creating a self-driving car simulator for Subaru. Prior to the \emph{Daiwa Scholarship}, I graduated from \emph{Imperial College London}, where I specialised in computational methods in optimisation for the design of autonomous drones, during which time I also completed an exchange with the \emph{National University of Singapore}.

%My applied knowledge in machine learning through working on state-of-the-art humanoid robots and autonomous drones and cars in Japan, coupled with a rigorous understanding of the underlying mathematics through research placements at leading AI research centres, and my recent masters course at UCL is what makes me the perfect candidate for the data scientist position at AZ analytics. I am \textbf{not} someone who throws a neural network at a training set, crossing their fingers in the hope that the magic of the black box will return valuable results. Rather, I am someone who engages with data, has the ability to tackle complex domains with the intuition of a statistician, the toolbox of a data scientist, and the logical mindset of an engineer.
